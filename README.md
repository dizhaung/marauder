# marauder
Marauder is an open source SIEM platform.

I had started to work on Marauder about 2 years ago and the project got left out, however there's enough code in Marauder that can be utilized by folks who may be interested in the individual modules of Marauder.

I will push some cycles to Marauder to finish what I originally started.
